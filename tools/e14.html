    rdaw:P10330 "Bach's 371 harmonized chorales (collected and published after his death by his son, C.P.E. Bach) are unique in achieving such a wide expressive range through such limited means. It has long been a tradition that students of harmony should, at some stage in their studies, imitate Bach's chorale harmonizations. Certainly, many diploma examinations and B.Mus. degrees have at least one question on the lines of /'Harmonize the following chorale tune in the style of Bach/', or /'Here is a harmonized chorale by Bach. Add orchestral parts and turn the whole into a cantata movement/'. The value and success of the study of Bach's chorale harmonizations largely depends on the extent to which the student assimilates this aspect of Bach's style.\nThis booklet illuminates the procedures adopted by Bach and, going beyond the conventional harmony textbook approach, discourses on how various harmonies occur, in what contexts and, where possible, why they occur. The student is led to a more satisfying appreciation of Bach's treatment of the chorale and, at the same time, gains a practical insight into an important period of musical history through wise analysis and emulation. The exercises offered are musically rewarding and allow the student to write /'live/' music rather than merely to jump through academic hoops."@en . # has note on work
